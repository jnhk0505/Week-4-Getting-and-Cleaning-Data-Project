## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Study design and data processing

### Data Source
Source data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Description of the dataset from the source website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Notes on the original data 
Please refer to README.TXT, which goes with other data tables for detailed description of original data.

## Creating the tidy datafile

### All Steps are done by *run_analysis.R*:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. The combined set is called tv_set. Train set has 7,352 observations and test set has 2,947 observations.   

2. Appropriately labels tv_set with descriptive variable names.

3. From tv_set in step 2, creates tv_set1 contains only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. This table has 10,299 observations and 79 variables and 2 columns to identify subject and activity (keys).


4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. The new set with activity names is called tv_set2. This set has 10,299 observations and 82 columns. 

#### Package Required

```
sqldf
```

5. *finalTidySet.txt* is the final independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#### Package Required

```
dplyr
```
